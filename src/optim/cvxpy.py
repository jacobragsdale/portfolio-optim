"""Solving a cvxpy problem the same way in every model, and reading its answer as a `Decision`. A model builds its problem,
directly or through a wrapper that hands back a cvxpy problem, then calls `solve` with the solve settings from its
params; a problem something else has solved, as a wrapper may, goes to `read`. The core never solves a model's problem
itself.

`solve` passes the solver its time limit and gap under the solver's own option names, and `warm_start=False`, since
cvxpy's default warm start made HiGHS re-solves about six times slower. `read` reads the solver's own status, because
cvxpy's loses what acceptance needs: it reports COPT stopped by its time limit as `optimal_inaccurate` with a solution
and `infeasible_inaccurate` without one. A decision is solved only when the solver proved its answer optimal within the
gap asked; one that stopped at its time limit keeps its trades, for the snapshot, and is rejected.

To read another solver's status exactly, add a reader to `_READERS`; any other solver is read from cvxpy's status."""
