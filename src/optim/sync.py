"""The agent files `optim sync` writes into a model repo, from the installed `optim`: the core's one-page contract, as
a marked block in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` pointing at it, and the core's skills, copied into `.agents/skills/optim-*`,
which Codex reads, and `.claude/skills/optim-*`, which Claude Code reads. They are copies rather than symlinks because
Git on Windows checks a symlink out as a plain text file unless Developer Mode and `core.symlinks` are on. A contract
test fails when the files do not match the installed `optim`, so an upgrade brings its guidance with it."""
