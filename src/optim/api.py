"""Running a model from Python, as a model's `main.py` does: `run`, `replay` and `sweep`, which `optim` exports. Each
takes the model's module first, `from models.income import model`, and runs as `optim run`, `optim replay` and
`optim sweep` do, through `optim.runs`, with four differences that suit an analyst's machine:

- A relative path is the model's folder's, wherever the IDE runs the file from, and `env` is found in the model's folder
  or a folder above it, up to the repo's root.
- The settings file's variables are set for the call alone and restored after it, so calls with different settings
  files do not mix, and logs are text unless the settings say otherwise.
- The snapshot is saved in the repo's `snapshots/`, unless `snapshots` says elsewhere; delete the folder whenever you
  like.
- No orders are written, whatever the settings file configures: only `optim run` writes them.

An error raises, with its traceback, so a debugger stops where it surfaced; a hook's error rejects its portfolio alone,
and its reason names the line of model code that raised."""
