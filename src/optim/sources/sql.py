"""Any DB-API driver as a `Source`. Queries are SQL files, named by their path inside the `optim` package.

A tuple param binds as one JSON array string, which the SQL unpacks with JSON_TABLE (Oracle) or OPENJSON (SQL Server):
one bind per batch, no IN-list limits, and no SQL built from strings.

A fetch outside a transaction opens its own connection and closes it. `read_only()` opens one connection for a block of
fetches, starts a read-only transaction on it, and rolls it back at the end; its fetches take turns on the connection,
since a DB-API connection is not safe to use from two threads at once. Rows are fetched in batches of 10,000, and a
query that returns more than `max_rows` fails.
